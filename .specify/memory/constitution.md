# Podsite Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity and Performance
Every feature must be implemented with a focus on simplicity and performance. This means writing clean, efficient code, minimizing dependencies, and ensuring the application is fast and lightweight.

### II. Spec-Driven Development
All features must be defined in a `spec.md` file before implementation. The specification must be clear, unambiguous, and approved before any code is written.

### III. Statelessness
The application must be stateless, with no server-side logic or database. All content is pre-built and served as static files. This ensures scalability, security, and simplicity.

## Development Workflow

The development process follows the Spec-Driven Development workflow, as defined in the project's `GEMINI.md` file. All work must adhere to this process, from specification to implementation.

## Governance

This Constitution is the supreme governing document for the Podsite project. It supersedes all other practices and conventions. Amendments to this Constitution require a formal proposal, review, and approval process.
